# environment.d(5) configuration snippet for setting environment variables for
# the XDG base directory specification:
#
#   https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
#
# There is a little chicken-or-egg issue here: systemd-environment-d-generator
# reads these files from ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:~/.config}/environment.d, whereas we
# don't set XDG_CONFIG_HOME until here.
#
# The following work-arounds (in descending priority) are:
#
#  0. If the system administrator is kind enough, set XDG_CONFIG_HOME at some
#     system-wide location (ideally only for our user).
#  1. If a config in /etc/pam.d/ loads pam_env.so with user_readenv=1, we use
#     ~/.pam_environment to define XDG_CONFIG_HOME. Note that this is no longer
#     the default (and future versions pam_env.so may even drop support for
#     ~/.pam_environment entirely), so this approach will stop working at some
#     point.
#  2. Create a compatibility symlink at ~/.config/environment.d or ~/.config.
